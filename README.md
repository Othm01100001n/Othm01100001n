Hi Everyone!

My name is Othman, I am a Computer Science Major. I learned how to code when I was in Highschool completely off of the internet.
I am very optimistic about the future of my generation, and I am very dedicated to provide for my community. 
 
(not me realizing this isn't my resume)
Anyways,
Rock On!
